## Signal Processing and Feature Extraction

This code snippet provides a collection of functions for signal processing and feature extraction, primarily designed for working with physiological signals, including ECG (Electrocardiogram) and PPG (Photoplethysmogram). These functions are valuable for extracting relevant information and features from these signals, facilitating various applications in healthcare, wearable technology, and beyond.

### Key Functions and Features

1. **Bandpass Filtering**
   - Function: `bandpass_filter(data, lowcut, highcut, fs, order=2)`
   - Description: Filters a signal within specified frequency limits to remove noise and retain relevant information.
2. **Signal Preprocessing**

   - Function: `preprocess_signal(signal, fs)`
   - Description: Applies bandpass filtering to a signal, preparing it for further analysis.

3. **Global Features Extraction**

   - Function: `global_features(signal, fs, is_ecg=False)`
   - Description: Extracts a set of statistical and spectral features from the entire signal, such as mean, median, variance, spectral entropy, and more.

4. **Local Features Extraction**

   - Function: `local_features(signal, fs, is_ecg=False)`
   - Description: Divides the signal into multiple windows and extracts features for each window. Useful for capturing local variations in the signal.

5. **Common Features Extraction**

   - Function: `common_features(signal, fs, is_ecg=False)`
   - Description: Extracts common statistical and spectral features, including mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and spectral entropy.

6. **Respiratory Rate Estimation**

   - Function: `estimate_respiratory_rate(signal, fs)`
   - Description: Estimates the respiratory rate from a signal by analyzing its frequency content.

7. **Motion Artifact Detection**
   - Function: `detect_motion_artifact(signal, threshold=1.0)`
   - Description: Detects motion artifacts in a signal based on its first derivative.

### Usage and Integration

These functions can be integrated into various applications, such as healthcare monitoring systems, fitness trackers, or signal processing pipelines. They provide a foundation for extracting meaningful insights from physiological data and improving the accuracy of health-related measurements.

Ensure that you adjust parameters and customize the functions to match the specific requirements of your project or application. Additionally, make use of relevant libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, PyWavelets, and HeartPy for comprehensive signal processing and analysis.
